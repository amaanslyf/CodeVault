# CodeVault: Your Beginner-Friendly Version Control System

## 👋 Welcome to CodeVault!

CodeVault is a simplified, Git-like version control system designed specifically for beginners. If you're new to the world of collaborative coding, tracking changes, and managing project history, CodeVault offers an intuitive way to get started without the steep learning curve of more complex systems.

It allows you to initialize repositories, track file changes, create commits, and synchronize your work with a remote server, all through a straightforward Command Line Interface (CLI) and a clean web-based dashboard.

## ✨ Features

CodeVault provides essential version control features to help you manage your projects effectively:

### 🌐 Web-Based Dashboard
*   **Intuitive UI:** Easily view and manage your repositories through a clean and responsive web interface.
*   **Repository Overview:** See a list of your own repositories and discover public projects from other users.
*   **Repository Details:** Dive into any repository to explore its files, commit history, and manage issues.
*   **Repository Creation:** Create new public or private repositories directly from the web.

### 📝 Issue Management
*   **Track Bugs & Features:** Create, view, update, and delete issues associated with your repositories.
*   **Collaborative:** Any logged-in user can contribute to issue management (update/delete) within a repository, fostering easy collaboration.
*   **Secure Visibility:** Issues in private repositories are only visible to the repository owner, ensuring sensitive project details remain confidential.

### 💻 Git-like Command Line Interface (CLI)
CodeVault offers familiar commands that mirror common Git operations, making the transition to professional version control smoother.

*   `codevault login`: Authenticate with your CodeVault account.
*   `codevault init`: Initialize a new CodeVault repository in your local project directory and link it to the remote.
*   `codevault add `: Stage changes for the next commit. Add specific files or all eligible files in the current directory.
*   `codevault commit ""`: Record your staged changes with a descriptive message.
*   `codevault push`: Upload your local commits to the remote CodeVault server.
*   `codevault pull`: Download the latest changes and history from the remote repository to your local machine.
*   `codevault revert `: Roll back your local project files to the state of a specific commit.

### 🔒 Robust Security
*   **User Authentication:** Secure signup and login with hashed passwords and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
*   **Access Control:** Strict authorization ensures only repository owners can manage repository settings (visibility, deletion).
*   **Data Protection:** Sensitive user information (like email addresses) is never exposed on public profiles. Issues in private repositories are secured from public viewing.
*   **Secure File Storage:** Repository files are stored securely on AWS S3, and access is managed via temporary, signed URLs.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Beginner-Friendly Guide)

Follow these steps to get CodeVault up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended) installed on your system.
*   npm (Node Package Manager) - comes with Node.js.
*   A MongoDB Atlas account (or a local MongoDB instance).
*   An AWS account with S3 bucket configured and IAM user credentials.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, get the CodeVault project onto your machine:

```
git clone 
cd codevault # Or whatever your project's root directory is
```

### 2. Backend Setup

The backend handles all the logic, database interactions, and file storage.

1.  **Navigate to the `backend` directory:**
    ```
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create your `.env` file:**
    In the `backend` directory, create a file named `.env`. This file will store your sensitive information. **Do NOT commit this file to Git!** Add it to your `.gitignore`.

    ```
    # backend/.env
    PORT=3002
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string_here # e.g., mongodb+srv://:@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/codevault?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_and_long_random_string_here_12345! # Generate a strong, random string
    
    AWS_REGION=your_aws_region # e.g., ap-south-1, us-east-1
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACTUAL_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_codevault_s3_bucket_name # e.g., codevaults3
    ```
    *Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and settings.*

4.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    You should see messages indicating that MongoDB is connected and the server is running on `http://localhost:3002`. Keep this terminal window open.

### 3. Frontend Setup

The frontend is your web interface for CodeVault.

1.  **Open a new terminal window** and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    This will usually open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### 4. CodeVault CLI Setup

To use the `codevault` commands globally on your system:

1.  **Open a new terminal window** (ensure it's not in the `backend` or `frontend` directory, ideally from your project root or anywhere you want to run `codevault` commands).
2.  **Navigate to the `backend` directory again:**
    ```
    cd backend
    ```
3.  **Link the CLI globally:**
    ```
    npm link
    ```
    This command makes `codevault` accessible from any directory in your terminal.

### 5. Using CodeVault (Your First Project!)

Now you're ready to use CodeVault like a pro!

#### Step 1: Log In to CodeVault

Open any terminal window (not the ones running your frontend/backend servers) and run:

```
codevault login
```
Follow the prompts to enter your email and password. This will save your authentication token so the CLI can interact with your backend.

#### Step 2: Initialize a New Repository

Navigate to an empty folder on your computer where you want to start a new project, or an existing project folder. For example:

```
mkdir my-first-codevault-project
cd my-first-codevault-project
codevault init
```
This will create a new repository on your CodeVault server and link your local folder to it. A `.codevault` directory will be created inside your project.

#### Step 3: Create and Add Files

Create some files in your `my-first-codevault-project` folder. For example, create a `hello.txt` file:

```
echo "Hello, CodeVault!" > hello.txt
```
Now, add your file(s) to the staging area:

```
codevault add hello.txt
# Or to add all new/modified files in the current directory:
# codevault add . 
```

#### Step 4: Commit Your Changes

Once files are added, commit them to your local history:

```
codevault commit "Initial commit: Added hello.txt"
```

#### Step 5: Push to CodeVault Server

Send your local commits to the remote CodeVault server:

```
codevault push
```
Now, check your CodeVault web dashboard (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)! You should see your new repository and its commit history.

#### Step 6: Make More Changes and Push Again

Modify `hello.txt` or create new files.

```
echo "This is a new line." >> hello.txt
codevault add .
codevault commit "Added a new line to hello.txt"
codevault push
```

#### Step 7: Pull Changes from Remote

If you (or a collaborator) made changes on another machine or directly through the web interface (if implemented), you can pull them:

```
codevault pull
```
This will update your local `.codevault/commits` directory.

#### Step 8: Revert to a Previous Commit

To go back to a specific version of your files, first find the `commit_id` from your web dashboard or `codevault pull` output. Then use:

```
codevault revert 
```
**Caution:** This will overwrite files in your current directory. Ensure you have backed up any uncommitted work.
